Different programming languages have the tools to work with files, databases, or network connections. Managing these resources is correctly quite tricky. You must release these resources after usage, not lock them from other programs or users. The improper usee of these resources can lead to memory leaks because modern operating systems limit resource use. Cases of exceeding these limits using files, databases, or network connections can be stopped by the operating system or any other resource management system.
